This is all the code written for my Extended project qualification titled:

**Exploring the emergent transport networks in algorithmic
approximations of Physarum polycephalum**
An exploration into emergent behaviour in simulations of cellular automata and
particle physics simulations

---

The project was written in C# and HLSL, cheifly using compute shaders to simulate the individual agents in the simulation.
